This repository contains the code for our arXiv paper, [FedSheafHN: Personalized Federated Learning on Graph-structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16056).

## Reproducing Results
To run our code use `sh ./scripts/disjoint.sh`.
Change the script content for different datasets and hyparameters.

## Reference
Our code is developed based on the following repo:

The neural sheaf model is from: [neural-sheaf-diffusion](https://github.com/twitter-research/neural-sheaf-diffusion/tree/master).

The data generator is from: [FED-PUB](https://github.com/JinheonBaek/FED-PUB).
